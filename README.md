# PocketPatch
## Synopsis

![](PocketPatch/assets/images/bearwithshadow.gif)

PocketPatch is a mobile app to be used to help users regulate their breathing patterns. By tapping the screen, the user can control a bear who directs the user when to inhale and exhale and earn points when the exercise is completed.

## Motivation

PocketPatch was created in hopes of assisting parents in calming their children when tantrums, outbursts or other mood swings occur. Children are able to practice regulating their breathing while parents can see the breathing history and developments of their children.
